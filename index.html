  <h1>Monday's Assignment: </h1>
  <ol>
    <li id="ques-one">Write a function called sum() that takes in two numbers as arguments and then returns the sum of those numbers. Have it console.log() the numbers and the sum with a message that exactly follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function: The sum of 4 and 7 is 11.</li>
    <p id="ans-one"></p>

    <li id="ques-two">Write a function called multiply() that takes in two numbers as arguments and then returns the product of those numbers. Have it console.log() the numbers and the product with a message that exactly follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function: The product of 4 and 7 is 28.</li>
    <p id="ans-two"></p>

    <li id="ques-three">Write a function called sumAndMultiply() that takes in THREE numbers as arguments and then returns two values in an array: the sum of those numbers and the product of those numbers. Use your existing sum() and product() functions to do these calculations, and be sure to turn off their console.log()s by commenting them out. Have this function do a console.log() of the numbers, the sum, and the product with two separate messages that exactly follows the examples below and uses the values that were input into the function: 4 and 7 and 5 sum to 16. The numbers 4 and 7 and 5 have a product of 140.</li>
    <p id="ans-three"></p>

    <li id="ques-four">Write a function called sumArray() that takes in an array of numbers as a single argument and then returns the sum of those numbers. Have it console.table() the array and console.log() the sum with a message that exactly follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function: 2,3,4 was passed in as an array of numbers, and 9 is their sum.</li>
    <p id="ans-four"></p>

    <li id="ques-five">Write a function called multiplyArray() that takes in an array of numbers as a single argument and then returns the product of those numbers. Have it console.table() the array and console.log() the product with a message that exactly follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function: The numbers 2,3,4 have a product of 20.</li>
